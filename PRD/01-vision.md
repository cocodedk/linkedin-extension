## 1. Vision

Enable B2B users (e.g. sales, compliance tool marketers) to extract useful lead information from LinkedIn search results with **one click**, store it locally, optionally evaluate leads via OpenAI, and export them for further use (e.g. CRM import) — available as parallel Chrome and Firefox builds.

**MVP promise:**

* Scrape current page’s visible LinkedIn search results.
* Save leads in browser storage with dedupe/merge.
* (Optional) Enrich/evaluate leads via OpenAI API.
* Export as CSV/JSON with AI insights.

No unnecessary bells & whistles (YAGNI).
